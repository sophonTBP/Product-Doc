                        We recommend a minimum of 8GB class 4 or class 10 microSD card. To save time, you can get a
                        card
                        that is pre-installed with NOOBS or Raspberry Pi OS, although setting up your own card is
                        easy.
                        The Raspberry Pi should work with any compatible SD card, although there are some guidelines
                        that
                        should be followed:
                        SD card size (capacity)
                        For installation of Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and recommended software (Full) via NOOBS
                        the
                        minimum card size is 16GB. For the image installation of Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and
                        recommended software, the minimum card size is 8GB. For Raspberry Pi OS Lite image
                        installations we
                        recommend a minimum of 4GB. Some distributions, for example LibreELEC and Arch, can run on
                        much
                        smaller cards. If you're planning to use a card of 64GB or more with NOOBS, see this
                        page first.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note: Only the Raspberry Pi 3A+, 3B+ and Compute Module 3+ can boot from an SD card larger
                        than 256
                        GB. This is because there was a bug in the SoC used on previous models of Pi.
                        SD card class
                        The card class determines the sustained write speed for the card; a class 4 card will be
                        able to
                        write at 4MB/s, whereas a class 10 should be able to attain 10 MB/s. However, it should be
                        noted
                        that this does not mean a class 10 card will outperform a class 4 card for general usage,
                        because
                        often this write speed is achieved at the cost of read speed and increased seek times.
                    </p>
                    <p>SD card physical size
                        The original Raspberry Pi Model A and Raspberry Pi Model B require full-size SD cards. From
                        the
                        Model B+ (2014) onwards, a micro SD card is required.</p>

                        The Raspberry Pi has an HDMI port which you can connect directly to a monitor or TV with an
                        HDMI
                        cable. This is the easiest solution; some modern monitors and TVs have HDMI ports, some do
                        not, but
                        there are other options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the Raspberry Pi 4 has two micro HDMI connectors, which require a good-quality
                        micro HDMI
                        cable, especially when using 4K monitors/TVs. Raspberry Pi sell a suitable cable; for more

                        <li>The Pi is powered by a USB Micro [models pre 4B] or USB Type-C [model 4B] power supply
                            (like
                            most standard mobile phone chargers).</li>
                        <li>You need a good-quality power supply that can supply at least 3A at 5V for the Model 4B,
                            2A at
                            5V for the Model 3B and 3B+, or 700mA at 5V for the earlier, lower-powered Pi models. We
                            recommend using the official Raspberry Pi power supply, which is designed specifically
                            for
                            Raspberry Pi.</li>
                        <li>Low-current (~700mA) power supplies will work for basic usage, but are likely to cause
                            the Pi to
                            reboot if it draws too much power. They are not suitable for use with the Pi 3 or 4.

                <article>
                    <p>On all models of Raspberry Pi since the Raspberry Pi B+ (2014) except the Zero range, there
                        is
                        low-voltage detection circuitry that will detect if the supply voltage drops below 4.63V
                        (+/- 5%).
                        This will result in a warning icon being displayed on all attached displays and an entry
                        being being
                        added to the kernel log.</p>
                    <p>If you are seeing warnings, you should improve the power supply and/or cable, as low power
                        can cause
                        problems with corruption of SD cards, or erratic behaviour of the Pi itself; for example,
                        unexplained crashes.</p>
                    <p>Voltages can drop for a variety of reasons, for example if the power supply itself is
                        inadequate, the
                        power supply cable is made of too thin wires, or you have plugged in high demand USB
                        devices.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Backpowering occurs when USB hubs do not provide a diode to stop the hub from powering
                        against the
                        host computer. Other hubs will provide as much power as you want out each port. Please also
                        be aware
                        that some hubs will backfeed the Raspberry Pi. This means that the hubs will power the
                        Raspberry Pi
                        through its USB cable input cable, without the need for a separate micro-USB power cable,
                        and bypass
                        the voltage protection. If you are using a hub that backfeeds to the Raspberry Pi and the
                        hub
                        experiences a power surge, your Raspberry Pi could potentially be damaged.</p>

                <p>Raspberry Pi have developed a graphical SD card writing tool that works on Mac OS, Ubuntu 18.04 and
                    Windows, and is the easiest option for most users as it will download the image and install it
                    automatically to the SD card.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download the latest version of Raspberry Pi Imager and install it. </li>
                    <li>If you want to use Raspberry Pi Imager on the Raspberry Pi itself, you can install it from a
                        terminal using <code>sudo apt install rpi-imager</code></li>
                    <li>Connect an SD card reader with the SD card inside.</li>
                    <li>Open Raspberry Pi Imager and choose the required OS from the list presented.</li>

                <p><b>Note:</b>if using the Raspberry Pi Imager on Windows 10 with Controlled Folder Access enabled, you
                    will need to explicitly allow the Raspberry Pi Imager permission to write the SD card. If this is
                    not done, Raspberry Pi Imager will fail with a "failed to write" error.</p>

                <p>You can now insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.

                    For the official Raspberry Pi OS, if you need to manually log in, the default user name is
                    <code>pi</code> , with password <code>raspberry</code>. Remember the default keyboard layout is set
                    to UK.

                    You should change the default password straight away to ensure your Raspberry Pi is secure.</p>
