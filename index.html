                            We recommend a minimum of 8GB class 4 or class 10 microSD card. To save time, you can get a
                            card
                            that is pre-installed with NOOBS or Raspberry Pi OS, although setting up your own card is
                            easy.
                            The Raspberry Pi should work with any compatible SD card, although there are some guidelines
                            that
                            should be followed:
                            SD card size (capacity)
                            For installation of Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and recommended software (Full) via NOOBS
                            the
                            minimum card size is 16GB. For the image installation of Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and
                            recommended software, the minimum card size is 8GB. For Raspberry Pi OS Lite image
                            installations we
                            recommend a minimum of 4GB. Some distributions, for example LibreELEC and Arch, can run on
                            much
                            smaller cards. If you're planning to use a card of 64GB or more with NOOBS, see this
                            page first.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Note: Only the Raspberry Pi 3A+, 3B+ and Compute Module 3+ can boot from an SD card larger
                            than 256
                            GB. This is because there was a bug in the SoC used on previous models of Pi.
                            SD card class
                            The card class determines the sustained write speed for the card; a class 4 card will be
                            able to
                            write at 4MB/s, whereas a class 10 should be able to attain 10 MB/s. However, it should be
                            noted
                            that this does not mean a class 10 card will outperform a class 4 card for general usage,
                            because
                            often this write speed is achieved at the cost of read speed and increased seek times.
                        </p>
                        <p>SD card physical size
                            The original Raspberry Pi Model A and Raspberry Pi Model B require full-size SD cards. From
                            the
                            Model B+ (2014) onwards, a micro SD card is required.</p>

                            The Raspberry Pi has an HDMI port which you can connect directly to a monitor or TV with an
                            HDMI
                            cable. This is the easiest solution; some modern monitors and TVs have HDMI ports, some do
                            not, but
                            there are other options.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that the Raspberry Pi 4 has two micro HDMI connectors, which require a good-quality
                            micro HDMI
                            cable, especially when using 4K monitors/TVs. Raspberry Pi sell a suitable cable; for more
                            details

                            <li>The Pi is powered by a USB Micro [models pre 4B] or USB Type-C [model 4B] power supply
                                (like
                                most standard mobile phone chargers).</li>
                            <li>You need a good-quality power supply that can supply at least 3A at 5V for the Model 4B,
                                2A at
                                5V for the Model 3B and 3B+, or 700mA at 5V for the earlier, lower-powered Pi models. We
                                recommend using the official Raspberry Pi power supply, which is designed specifically
                                for
                                Raspberry Pi.</li>
                            <li>Low-current (~700mA) power supplies will work for basic usage, but are likely to cause
                                the Pi to
                                reboot if it draws too much power. They are not suitable for use with the Pi 3 or 4.

                    <article>
                        <p>On all models of Raspberry Pi since the Raspberry Pi B+ (2014) except the Zero range, there
                            is
                            low-voltage detection circuitry that will detect if the supply voltage drops below 4.63V
                            (+/- 5%).
                            This will result in a warning icon being displayed on all attached displays and an entry
                            being being
                            added to the kernel log.</p>
                        <p>If you are seeing warnings, you should improve the power supply and/or cable, as low power
                            can cause
                            problems with corruption of SD cards, or erratic behaviour of the Pi itself; for example,
                            unexplained crashes.</p>
                        <p>Voltages can drop for a variety of reasons, for example if the power supply itself is
                            inadequate, the
                            power supply cable is made of too thin wires, or you have plugged in high demand USB
                            devices.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>Backpowering occurs when USB hubs do not provide a diode to stop the hub from powering
                            against the
                            host computer. Other hubs will provide as much power as you want out each port. Please also
                            be aware
                            that some hubs will backfeed the Raspberry Pi. This means that the hubs will power the
                            Raspberry Pi
                            through its USB cable input cable, without the need for a separate micro-USB power cable,
                            and bypass
                            the voltage protection. If you are using a hub that backfeeds to the Raspberry Pi and the
                            hub
                            experiences a power surge, your Raspberry Pi could potentially be damaged.</p>
